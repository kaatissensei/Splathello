# Splathello
Splatoon-themed Othello

Teams take turns choosing squares on the board to fill with their team's color. If they sandwich another team's square(s) with two of their own - called "outflanking" in Othello - then all squares in between will flip to their color. For example, OXXO will become OOOO. This can be done horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Whoever has captured the most squares at the end wins.

To play, simply tap a squid to select that color, then tap any square to fill it in. Standard Othello rules say that you must choose a square touching one of the other colors, but I did not force that in the coding.

This version can be played with 2, 4, or even 8 groups (two groups per color). When playing in 8 Player mode, the token bar can be used to display the order. Printable tokens can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TEIdp7Szh0Hmi8ZQkPYn4pY30Vx22S70/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113014989840421042872&rtpof=true&sd=true) or on the ALTopedia page for this game.

# Game Examples
JHS

In my 2年生 classes, I used this in tandem with website [justbuzz.in](justbuzz.in). Each group had one tablet with a textbox and a buzzer. I would ask a question, and they would type their answer into the box and buzz in. Once all teams had buzzed in, we went through all the answers as a class, correcting them when necessary. If their team's answer was OK, they would have a chance to tap a square on the Splathello board in the order that they buzzed in. You could probably play this game going in order (clockwise, etc.), but at the beginning of the game, there's an advantage to teams who go first, so I opted for the buzzer method to make it more random. 
Another option is having them write their answer on a piece of paper, then bring it up to you to check.

ES/Special Needs

This can be used to practice numbers, or asking questions in a similar way to the JHS game, but in a set order.
Alternatively, you can turn on the Headers (ABC for columns, 123 for rows). Assign a word to each row and column, and have the students make sentences using those words to select a square. For example, if A-G are colors (A=red, etc.) and 1-6 are shapes (1=circle, etc.), A1 could be chosen by saying "(I want) a <ins>red circle</ins> please."
